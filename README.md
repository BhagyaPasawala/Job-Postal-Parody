StinkedIn is the anti-networking platform you never knew you needed! A parody of the corporate social network. Instead of showing off polished résumés and endless success stories, here you can embrace your inner chaos and laugh at the struggles of the modern job hunt. Whether you're a sleep-deprived coder, an overworked intern, or just tired of “networking”, StinkedIn is your space to vent, joke, and connect with others who understand that sometimes.. things just stink! 😄

Built using ReactJs, for now this is just a front-end UI project, but I am working on its backend so that anyone can post anything they want.

StinkedIn is a parody project created solely for fun and educational purposes. It is not intended for commercial use, and I do not earn any profit from this project. And this project is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by LinkedIn. The purpose of StinkedIn is to practice and showcase my coding skills, and no infringement is intended.

But still, if anyone's offended, you have my regards.
